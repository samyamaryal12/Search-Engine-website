There lived an ant and a grasshopper. The ant was a hard worker. But the grasshopper was lazy. In summer days, he carried the food and saved for the future. When the winter came, the grasshopper asked the ant for some food. Then the ant asked, " What were you doing in summer instead of collecting the food?" The grasshopper said, "I was singing in the beautiful summer." The ant replied, "I have enough only for my family and me. Now go and dance in the winter."
