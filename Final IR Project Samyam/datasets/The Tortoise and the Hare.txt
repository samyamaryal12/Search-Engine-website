Once there was a race going on. A tortoise and a Hare participated when the hare started to run faster. After a while, the hare stopped near a tree and looked back. He couldn't find the tortoise anywhere near him. He thought that the tortoise was lagging. So he started to sleep under the tree. When he woke up, he couldn't see the tortoise. He started to run again towards the final point. But when he got there, he was surprised. The race was already finished. The tortoise has reached there before him. The tortoise has won the game, even if he was the slowest one.
