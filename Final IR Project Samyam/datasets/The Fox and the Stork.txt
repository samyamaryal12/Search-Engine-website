
One day the fox invited the stock to his house. He served the soup in bowls for both of them. It was easy for him, but the stock could not eat the food properly because of his beak. The stock ok was angry, but it did not say anything. The next day the stock invited the fox. He also prepared the soup. But he put the soup in a vas. It was hard for the fox this time because the vas had a narrower neck, and the fox could reach.
