One day a woodcutter went to a forest to cut wood. When he was cutting a tree near the river, suddenly his axe fell into the river. It was his only tool to make his living. He sat near the river and started to cry. God noticed this and appeared there. He asked the woodcutter, "Why are you crying"?". The Woodcutter replied, " I've lost my axe." Then God showed him a golden axe and asked questions," Is this your axe?". woodcutter replied no. Then God showed him a silver axe and asked, "Is this yours?" He again replied no. Finally, God showed him his wooden axe. The woodcutter smiled and said, " Yes. It is my axe." God was pleased with his honesty. He gifted him all three axes.
