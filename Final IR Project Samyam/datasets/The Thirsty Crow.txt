On a summer afternoon, a crow felt thirsty. She looked here and there but could not find a single drop of water. After a long time, she found a pitcher. There were few drops of water inside this. But the crow could not reach that water. She started to feel more thirsty. She again looked at her surroundings and found some pebbles nearby. So she took the pebbles one by one and started to drop them inside the pitcher. Then water level started to increase. When she finally dropped all the pebbles, the water level reached her. She drank the water and queen hard thirst.
